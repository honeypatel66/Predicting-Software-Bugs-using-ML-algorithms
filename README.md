# Predicting-Software-Bugs-using-ML-algorithms

Since the field of software engineering is expanding; it is vital to prevent the software from being faulty. In this project, I have applied machine learning algorithms to make predictions of bugs in software. 

The following machine learning techniques are used in this project: 
- Random Forest (RF)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes (NB)
- Logistic Regression (LR)

Also, a comparative analysis of these algorithms is done based on their accuracy. I have used the PROMISE Software Engineering Repository Datasets namely JM1, KC1, and PC1 and got 88% accuracy for predicting bugs in JM1, 90% in KC1, and 95% in PC1 using different algorithms.
